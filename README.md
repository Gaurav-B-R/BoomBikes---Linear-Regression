<h1>BoomBikes Linear Regression</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Linear Regression was performed on <b>Boombikes</b> bike rental dataset. Multiple LR models were built using the last two years' data and best-trained model was selected based on the R-squared, VIF, and RFE analysis. The final model had an R-squared value of 0.82 and could explain 82% of the variance quite accurately in the dependent variable. Factors and their rate of effect on the business were provided.</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>A bike-sharing system is a service that makes bikes available to people for short-term, shared use that can be paid for or provided for free. Many bike share programmes enable users to pick up a bike from a "dock," which is typically computer-controlled and where they enter their payment details to have the bike unlocked. Then, you can return this bike to a different system-affiliated dock.</p>

<p>The ongoing Corona pandemic has recently caused a US bike-sharing company, BoomBikes, to experience significant drops in revenue. In the current market environment, it is extremely difficult for the organisation to remain viable. It has therefore made the conscious decision to develop a business plan that will enable it to increase revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown ends and the economy returns to a healthy state.</p>

<p>BoomBikes hopes to understand how people will feel about shared bikes when the current Covid-19-related nationwide quarantine situation ends in this effort. In order to differentiate themselves from other service providers, meet the requirements of the populace, and create significant profits, they have designed this.</p>

They seek to comprehend the variables that affect the demand for these shared bikes. They particularly wish to comprehend what influences demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands
The service provider company has compiled a sizable dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on a number of weather surveys and people's lifestyles.

<p>I have to use the available independent variables to model the demand for shared bikes. The management will use it to determine precisely how the needs change with changing features. They can adjust their business approach in accordance with demand levels and client expectations. The model will also help management better grasp the dynamics of demand in a new market.</p>
